## Overview 
• Get instant insights from your Documents
This chatbot is built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging Google's Generative AI model Gemini-2.5-flash. It processes uploaded PDF documents by breaking them down into manageable chunks, creates a searchable vector store, and generates accurate answers to user queries. This advanced approach ensures high-quality, contextually relevant responses for an efficient and effective user experience.

## How It Works
Follow these simple steps to interact with the chatbot:

1. Enter Your API Key: You'll need a Google API key for the chatbot to access Google's Generative AI models. Obtain your API key https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey.

2. Upload Your Documents: The system accepts multiple PDF files at once, analyzing the content to provide comprehensive insights.

3. Ask a Question: After processing the documents, ask any question related to the content of your uploaded documents for a precise answer.
